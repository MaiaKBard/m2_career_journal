# Mod 2 Career Journal
You will use the prompts in this README to reflect on your Mod 2 projects.  The point of this career journal is to assist you in keeping track of the "story" of your Turing journey! When you start interviewing, writing your resume, and are fully on the job hunt, these details will be super handy for you to have. 

At the end of each project (eval days are great for this), carefully consider and fill out each project's reflection questions below.

## Set Up Instructions
- Create your own document to use for this career journal - your own private gist, a google doc, or another document of your choice.
- Copy/paste the prompts below from this README into that document.  If you are using a gist, you'll want to copy/paste the raw markdown from this README.  You can see that by clicking on the README.md file to open it, then selecting `Code` to see the markdown.
- After you've done that, please DM your instructors a link to your document.

### Solo Project Reflections

1. At the beginning of the project, what part(s) of the project were you most nervous about? At the end, do you feel those concerns were justified?
 - Everything I felt like from the begining I was not grasping the cecepts of JS very well and HTML & CSS I think I understood alil better but still felt confusing in ways. I think in completion of the proect it did help me understand alil better and fill in a couple gaps but I think some of the baseline concepts im still not grasping. More along the lines of when I use certain things and exactly what they are/are doing.
 - 
2. Describe one thing you got stuck on during the project. Based on that experience, have you made/do you plan to make any specific changes to the way you prepare for the next project?
    - I think I defintly need to be better at time management especially when my mental health his causing disrutption to my ability to focus. I feel like if my mental health is bad at the momemt I should try to implement a schedule and stick to it so I am not just pushing and pushing until suddenly I need to take off entire day because of it. I also I spent to much time in an unproductie struggle so I prolly need to learn better when I need to just take a break and when I need to reach out for help. I think it might be nice if I could make a connection if a deveoper who is expirenced in JS so I could ask them questions.
      
3. List 2-3 bullet points about your process and/or accomplishments from working on this project (things you could highlight on your resume). 
 - Creating functioning code
 - Good baseline organization
